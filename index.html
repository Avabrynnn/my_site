        <h1><strong>AVA HYLAND</strong></h1>
        <p>I am a contemporary artist based in New York City, specializing in mixed media and digital art. Currently studying at The New School, my work explores themes of identity, technology, and environmental consciousness.</p>
        <p>With a background in traditional painting techniques and a growing interest in digital media, I create pieces that bridge the gap between conventional art forms and new technological possibilities.</p>
