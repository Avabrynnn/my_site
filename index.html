            <h1>Ava Hyland</h1>
            <p>Visual artist and illustrator with a passion for capturing the essence of human emotion through portraiture and mixed media art. My work explores the intersection of traditional techniques and contemporary themes, creating pieces that resonate with both classic artistry and modern sensibilities.</p>
            <p>New York based visual artist and illustrator, Ava Hyland, has been honing her illustration abilities all her life. Originally focused more in design, Ava was able to blend her knowledge of design, and passion for art in a perfect union. She focuses in furniture design, alongside portraiture work. Ava currently is in her undergrad at Parsons School of Design focusing in Illustration. When she's not working, she loves spending time with her cats, spending time going to concerts, and walk dogs around her neighborhood.</p>
